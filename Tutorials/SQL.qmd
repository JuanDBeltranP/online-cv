**Tutorial: SQL from Basics to Advanced Topics**

Introduction:

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases. This tutorial will introduce you to SQL, starting with the basics and advancing to more complex topics.

**Part I: SQL Basics**

**1.1: Creating a Database**

Creating a database is the first step in SQL. The `CREATE DATABASE` statement is used to do this.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE myDatabase;
```

**1.2: Creating a Table**

Tables are created within a database to store data. The `CREATE TABLE` statement is used, followed by the columns' names and data types.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(100),
    LastName VARCHAR(100),
    Email VARCHAR(50),
    Age INT
);
```

**1.3: Inserting Data**

The `INSERT INTO` statement is used to insert data into a table.

```sql
INSERT INTO Employees (ID, FirstName, LastName, Email, Age)
VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', 30);
```

**1.4: Querying Data**

The `SELECT` statement is used to select data from a database.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees;
```

**Part II: SQL Intermediate**

**2.1: WHERE Clause**

The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Age > 30;
```

**2.2: UPDATE Statement**

The `UPDATE` statement is used to modify existing records in a table.

```sql
UPDATE Employees SET Email = 'j.doe@example.com' WHERE ID = 1;
```

**2.3: DELETE Statement**

The `DELETE` statement is used to delete existing records in a table.

```sql
DELETE FROM Employees WHERE ID = 1;
```

**Part III: SQL Advanced**

**3.1: JOIN**

A `JOIN` clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column.

```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers
ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
```

**3.2: GROUP BY**

The `GROUP BY` statement groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into aggregated data.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(ID), Age
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Age;
```

**3.3: Subqueries**

A subquery is a query nested inside another query and can be used in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements.

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees
WHERE Age > (SELECT AVG(Age) FROM Employees);
```

**3.4: Views**

A view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table.

```sql
CREATE VIEW [Old Employees] AS
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees
WHERE Age > 60;
```
