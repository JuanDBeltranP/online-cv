Hi! I am a senior data scientist passionate about developing useful, effective and practical data science products to solve commercial problems in different industries. I have a strong academic background and I build my data solutions following rigorous and pragmatic data science principles. I love analysing and solving complex problems that involve data analysis. I am always eager to learn new techniques and knowledge to incorporate them into my data science toolbox.

I have been coding in R for the last 14 years and in Python for the last 8 years. I have designed, developed and maintained a wide range of data products which combine machine learning models and GIS analysis in the shape of stand alone models, dashboards, advanced visualisation, automatic reports, and web apps. I have extensive knowledge in statistical modelling, forecasting time series and geospatial analysis.

When I am not coding I enjoy gardening, travelling, or sharing time with my husband and my dog!
