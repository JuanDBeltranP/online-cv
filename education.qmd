## Education

**2013-2017:** **University of Oxford, DPhil (PhD) Plant Sciences**

During my PhD I used machine learning, extensive computational modelling and advanced statistics to understand how plants save water under drought stress. I also studied the relationship between climatic variables and the distribution of species under existing climatic scenarios and under climate change scenarios. I used different approaches to test the differences between the "climatic niche" of water-saving and non-water-saving plants including Neural networks, XGBoost, Random Forest, and Clustering analysis. I also conducted A/B tests using bootstrapping and Bayesian statistics. These analyses were conducted using R and Python.\

**2012:** **MSc Biology (1st place), Universidad de los Andes (Colombia)**

I used R to test different hypotheses concerning changes in the biochemistry of juvenile plants when they experienced drought.

**2010:** **BSc Biology, Universidad de los Andes (Colombia)**

I learned R in 2008 as part of my biostatistics course, used extensively in my dissertation and since then I have not stopped using it.
